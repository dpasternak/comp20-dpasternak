-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: Due to a minor bug, it is often neccesary to refresh the page several
times to get it to load properly. If the nearest station is listed in the blue
box, the page load was successful

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What has been correctly implemented and what has not?

correctly implemented:

The map correctly loads and centers on your geolocated position. It also
identifies the nearest subway station on the given line, and gives the distance
to that station. If any of the markers are clicked on, an infowindow containing
a timetable will appear.

incorrectly implemented:
Due to a bug that i can't find, the map often takes several times to
load properly. The output to console when this occurs is as follows
If you refresh the page, it will load correctly eventually. (may take
many many many refreshes, but it will load)

Collaboration: none

Time Spent: 15 hours
